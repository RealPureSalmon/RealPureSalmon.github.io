MSVC. Possibly the most insane tool out there. It is sold as a C & C++ compiler,
when in reality it is a torture compiler. I have never compiled a program with MSVC
that *hasn't* had any bug that wouldn't have come up in GCC or Clang. It's stupid!
Hell, the ``stdint.h`` library didn't exist for the longest time! And *still*, it
*barely* works! I use clang now, btw.

*"Well, what about the title of this post? 'The stolen bytes', what's that?"*.
I'll explain that to you now. Firstly, take a look at this code:

{% highlight cpp %}
int p;
int i1;
int i2;
i1 = 1 << 16;
i2 = 1 << 8;
p = int(&i1)+3;

cout << hex;
cout << "&i1: " << int(&i1) << endl;
cout << "&i2: " << int(&i2) << endl;
for(int i = 0; i < 16; i++)
  cout << p << ": " << uint(*((byte*)p--)) << endl;
{% endhighlight %}

Then, let's run it:

{% highlight cpp %}
&i1: 12fac8
&i2: 12fabc
12facb: 0
12faca: 1
12fac9: 0
12fac8: 0
12fac7: cc
12fac6: cc
12fac5: cc
12fac4: cc
12fac3: cc
12fac2: cc
12fac1: cc
12fac0: cc
12fabf: 0
12fabe: 0
12fabd: 1
12fabc: 0
{% endhighlight %}

Still not getting it? Okay, let me rephrase that text for you: See the ``cc``
values right there? They are useless addresses. ``0xcc`` is a commonly used
"nothing" address, as it is almost impossible for the kernel to invoke.
There are 8 useless bytes between the two aligned integers
on the stack. Why is this? These are padding bytes, they are used so that..?
Wait, what? MSVC is *stealing* 8 bytes for "padding" when they could *easily*
be compressed. MSVC is a *thief*. This makes a lot of programs *much* slower!
Think about this on a larger scale! I call the above code 1024 times!
8 * 1024 is 8000 bytes! 8KB have now been used. Let's do that 1024 times.
8 * 1024 is still 8000... MEGABYTES!!! 8MB. Let's repeat *that* 1024 times.
Now, 8 * 1024 continues to be 8000... But the value increases to *GIGABYTES*!?
8GB of *nothing* is now on your system! You have wasted 8GB! This is of course
an exaggeration, (8 * 1024) * 3 is not an equation you see in the wild often,
but this means that MSVC is using up space on your system!!! MSVC could theoretically
take up your entire system with useless padding. Though incredibly unlikely, a
malicous attacker could theoretically do something like this:

{% highlight cpp %}
void evil() {
    int p;
    int i1;
    int i2;
    i1 = 1 << 16;
    i2 = 1 << 8;
    p = int(&i1)+3;
}

int main() {
    int i = 0;
    while (true) {
        while (++i < 1024) {
            evil();
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

This would fill up your system with bytes upon bytes, like this:
- 8B
- 8KB
- 8MB
- 8GB
- A standard computer would die around here.
- 8TB
- 8PB
- A really big data center would die around here.
- 8EB
- Every thought any human being has ever had would fit here.
- 8ZB
- 8YB
- If someone took in this information, they would probably collapse
  into a black hole.

Do you understand now? In just 9 iterations of this program, we could
*probably* create a black hole. MSVC wastes *a lot* of memory in the
long run. Just to get a picture, MSVC's padding takes up
around the space of a single chrome tab. *REALLY BIG*.

Anyway, that was just my rambling. I'm way to lazy to contribute
anything interesting to society. I was actually planning to make
a blog post called "I'm too lazy" but I was too lazy to even
do that. Anyway... Enjoy my incredible rambling about MSVC
wasting 8B of space. Wait... Was this blog post meaningless?
I'm going to contemplate my blog post now, bye!
