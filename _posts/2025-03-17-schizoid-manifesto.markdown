## DISCLAIMER
This is a blog post analyzing a manifesto mentioned in my eBook:
Waiting for Marxocracy[\[1\]](https://elisstaaf.github.io/books/waiting-for-marxocracy/prologue); in said book,
I believe I said *this*:

*In reality, the only people hating Godot after this is homophobic and transphobic
media, no one else. A very good example of demented people criticizing Godot is
this schizophrenic “[justice manifesto](https://waiting-for-blue-robot.gitlab.io/justice_manifesto.html)”
by “XRayez”.*

This post is not only analyzing *that* specific part of this conservative schizoid's
manifesto, but the whole thing.

## Who and what?
This conservative manifesto is about Godot; game engine extraordinaries may remember
Godot for being the game engine that doesn't abuse the people working on it (I'm
looking at you: *UNITY*). But a few months ago, it happened; Godot... WAS WOKE!?
Yeah, how the turn-tables! Who would've "thunk" it, this game engine... DOESN'T
WANT HOMOSEXUAL'S SKULLS BASHED IN!? Or, well, the PR team posted this:

*“Apparently game engines are woke now? Well then, we won’t complain!
Show us your #wokot games below!”*

Yes, I know; the west has fallen. So this """""awesome""""" conservative -- XRayez --
has taken it upon himself to debunk Godot, once and for all... Conservatives.

## XRayez
XRayez -- like every conservative -- sees himself as a vigilante saving the common
people. This is evident in his "about the author"[\[2\]](https://waiting-for-blue-robot.gitlab.io/index.html#about-the-author)
spiel he put in the beginning of his book:

```
Andrii Doroshenko is a software developer specializing in game development. In 2017, he came across Godot Engine.
In 2018, he earned a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Kyiv National University of Culture and Arts. He
played a key role in the development and support of Godot, actively contributing to Godot’s development for five
straight years on a voluntary basis. In 2021, he officially took on the role of a Godot Engine maintainer.

Andrii is the co-author of Godot Engine. In 2022, he ranked in the Top 20 contributors by the number of changes
to Godot Engine. He has submitted over 200 pull requests and proposed dozens of popularly demanded features. He
revamped the unit testing system in Godot, turning it into a fully functional feature. He has played a crucial
role in improving Godot’s build system and is the brains behind the custom modules feature.

Among other notable contributions, he implemented features like boolean operations on polygons, as seen in the
Geometry singleton. Many of the destructible features you come across in games made with Godot are there thanks to
Andrii’s contributions to Godot\[.]
```

Did you hear that? He's *the* co-author of Godot Engine. Or, I guess he isn't? According to him,
he *"saw trough the lies of Juan (the Godot head-maintainer) and left the Godot engine and is
now spreading the truth of the evilness of the Godot project"* (unofficial quote, but that's
basically what the whole manifesto is about); according to *reality*, though, he left the
Godot project because he's a schizo-paranoid maniac who believes everyone in the Godot
project is against him and that they've created a "cult". Like... What is he talking about?

## (((them)))
XRayez *really* -- and I mean *really* -- wants to emphasize that "Godot is a cult". He wants
to emphasize it so much that -- in his manifesto -- he has a whopping *12* chapters about
it, including thrilling pieces such as[\[3\]](https://waiting-for-blue-robot.gitlab.io/cult/leader.html):
```
Quote #1: "Before delving into the topic, it’s worth noting that Juan Linietsky was born in Argentina.
There are many cults in Latin America, ranging from destructive cults to more controversial
ones./.../Due to this, Juan could consciously or unconsciously adopt cultic techniques to utilize
in his own community of Godot followers."

Response #1: Just because someone grows up in a place where some belief is prevalent, doesn't mean
that they will adopt such beliefs. As an example, I live in Sweden, there are a lot of nazi
hate-groups in Sweden. I'm not a nazi, quite the opposite, actually.

Quote #2: "Juan continues saying “live and let live”. This is how narcissists play the victim to deflect
criticism. They induce guilt so that you cannot possibly say anything bad about them or expose their lies,
because of this false sense of victimhood. There are testimonies that reinforce the idea that Godot is an
actual cult, so Juan finds it necessary to divert the attention from those testimonies and block criticism
of Godot."

Response #2: There is no "false sense of victimhood". Small (or even big) open-source projects often get
stomped down by bigger (COMMERCIAL) projects. Also, "live and let live" is very much a valid thing to
say, whether it's about FOSS or trans people.
```

I find it very entertaining how he just grasps at straws, like "Juan was born in Argentina and that
means he's a cult leader because cults exist in Latin America". It's very strange how he just *can't*
grasp that a *community* != a *cult*.

## The """""Justice""""" Manifesto
In XRayez's questionably named justice manifesto[\[4\]](https://waiting-for-blue-robot.gitlab.io/justice_manifesto.html),
he desperately attempts to make his ideas sound somewhat coherent, but fails. He says very...
Entertaining things that just makes his manifesto look like a giant circus, take a look:

```
I absolutely know what you’re doing, and I see right through you. Even though I may not be able to restore
justice all by myself, the already invented wheels of justice are turning against you. I am committed to
ensuring that the truth comes to light and that the appropriate actions are taken at the right moment.
```

By wheels of justice he means... The #wokot situation, which is not a wheel of justice but rather
a situation escalated by conservative clowns that don't grasp that progressivism is *the* future
(and a better one that conservatism).

```
I will work diligently to expose the truth, gather even more evidence, and cooperate with the appropriate
authorities if needed, such as the Anti-Fraud Office. It is my duty to ensure that the truth prevails and that
those who engage in fraudulent and discriminatory activities within an allegedly worldwide organization such as
Godot Engine, which exploits the free labor of individuals who are unknowingly working on the personal agenda of
toxic leaders, face the consequences of their actions.
```

What XRayez means is that he's going to report Juan Linietsky to the authorities because...
\*checks notes\* His engine has a community that doesn't want Xrayez's relentless hate?

```
Even though you may have a considerable number of overzealous followers who unquestioningly support you and are
seemingly willing to protect your image, bear in mind that their allegiance is primarily driven by their own
desire to maintain the narcissistic image that you managed to craft yourself. However, when faced with facts,
evidence, and testimonies, these followers will eventually have to confront the truth and go through all the
stages of denial, shock, acceptance, grieving, despise, contemplation, and finally, moving on.
```

Besides giving "Progressives OWNED by facts and logic" vibes, it's also really weird. XRayez...
Do you *think* these people are as stupid as you? If you do, stop thinking that; if you don't,
stop saying that they'll join your side.

## Conclusion
XRayez is a schizoid, ultra-paranoid and conservative. Yep, that's the conclusion.
