# Code of conduct
*"If you need a paper to tell you what you can and can't do,
you were never welcome in the first place."*  
\- Me, right now.

A code of conduct is... Well, a code of conduct. It tells FOSS
contributors what they can and can't do, the typical code of
conduct goes like this:

## General COC
*"Don't discriminate against people."*, or if you're lame:
*"We are committed to providing a friendly and safe environment for everyone,
regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity,
language proficiency, age, political orientation, nationality, religion,
or other similar characteristics. We do not tolerate harassment or
discrimination of participants in any form. In particular, we strive
to be welcoming to all industry minorities and to ensure that they can
take a more active role in the community and the project. Targeted
harassment of minorities is unacceptable."*

## The marxocratic stance
The marxocratic stance on this subject is

*"If you need a paper to tell you what you can and can't do,
you were never welcome in the first place."*

Like the first quote of this chapter! Act like a good person, isn't that
expected of you!? I think I, in a [commit I made](https://github.com/ElisStaaf/pearlOS/commit/b134e6be05f8bd3248853e9cd49c60661b8e2b20)
to my OS: PearlOS, explained it best:

*A few weeks ago I saw some community standards on how to make a \[Github]
repo. I, eagerly waiting for something to do, added these in with
delight. Now, looking back, I realize that the community standards were
utter and complete bullshit and that you should never follow them. I
think it also gave of a corporatized "squeaky clean" look. For example
with the "CODE OF CONDUCT". Like, what the fuck? I am a firm believer
that software should not be corporatized, and this just felt wrong.
Also, if you need a document to tell you what you can and can't do; I
don't want your \[contribution]. Isn't it like implied that you shouldn't
be racist, sexist and homophobic? Who thinks "Hmm... I wonder if I can
say something bad about gay people here. Let's check the code of conduct!
Then I'll know if I can be an anti-gay womanizer \[nazi]!"!? If anyone
reading this needs an arbitrary paper to tell you what to do; get out.*

It's strange how... "Corporate" FOSS has become these days. Once upon a
time... It wasn't, but now everything is corporate. IT'S IMPLIED THAT
YOU SHOULDN'T BE RACIST, SEXIST AND HOMOPHOBIC, JUST LIKE IT IS IN
REAL LIFE! Only conservatives and fascists believe that it's acceptable
to be any of these things, and I don't want conservatives and fascists
contributing to my project. The only acceptable type of discrimination
is political discrimination in the pursuit of egalitarianism. Fascists
are *not* welcome in my project!

## Egalitarianism
is expected. It's not difficult to assume that everyone is equal. In a
sense, there *is* a marxocratic code of conduct, it's just implied. One
could say that this is the *actual* marxocratic code of conduct:

We, the developers of the FOSS-project, pledge to follow this code of
conduct to any cost. There are 3 core rules to this code of conduct,
they are

1. Egalitarianism. Everyone is equal, regardless of gender, age, experience,
race, ethnicity, nationality religion and other similar traits.
2. Collectivism. The source code of this software is owned collectively
by every contributor, and as such: No one can govern it themselves.
3. Marxocracy. Follow the marxocratic principles at all costs.

A *lot* of other rules are implied, and you -- a hopefully decent person --
can probably understand, imply and apply them yourself.

## Satirical COC
The *other* terrible thing about COCs is that no one ever follows them.
A COC to incorporate all of the rule-breaking would be something like

*We are committed to providing an unfriendly and unsafe environment for everyone.
We should discriminate against people regardless of level of experience, gender
identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
body size, race, ethnicity, language proficiency, age, political orientation,
nationality, religion, or other similar characteristics. We tolerate harassment
and discrimination of participants in all forms. In particular, we strive to
discriminate against all industry minorities and to ensure that they can stop
playing an active role in the community and the project. Targeted harassment
of minorities is acceptable.*

## fix: Remove CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
You should always push for the abolition of the code of conduct. Please, if
you are a frequent contributor of *any* project with a code of conduct, push
for the abolition of it or at least introduce the [Marxocratic COC](#egalitarianism), I beg you.
It's expected of you to be a good person, and to do that, you don't need a
paper to tell you what to do. Be egalitarian and you will not be persecuted,
it's not that difficult. Try to open an issue or make contact with the maintainer
of the FOSS-project and push for the abolition of the COC. If you *are* the
maintainer, abolish it yourself. Be moral, I beg of you.
