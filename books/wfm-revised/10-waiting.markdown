# Waiting
I'm sure you've heard of *Waiting for Godot*. It's a play by Samuel Beckett,
in which two people: Vladimir and Estragon, wait for the titular character
of "Godot". These people -- despite, deep in their hearts, knowing that
Godot will never arrive -- remain hopeful! But yet (SPOILER ALERT) Godot
never arrives. This play -- despite being: Well, a play -- is also symbolic,
in a way. It teaches us not to wait for change, but push it.

## Who is Godot?
Godot -- in the original play -- is a man that *possibly* exists. The characters
don't really know if they've ever met him or if they ever will, yet they're
somehow sure he's a real person and not some schizophrenic illusion. It's a
very *mysterious* play, since Godot is not elaborated on further than the
fact that Vladimir and Estragon are waiting for him.

I believe that Godot is real since -- around the end of the play -- a boy
arrives to tell Vladimir (because it is *only* Vladimir, since he's the
thinking man) that Godot is not coming. The boy can provide an...
Uncertain description of Godot, the most prominent feature of Godot
being his white beard which the boy is somewhat sure of Godot inhibiting.

## Symbolism
*Waiting for Godot* tells us that, in my interpretation:

*It's not in your best interests for you to wait, yet not act. Vladimir
-- the thinking man -- thinks, yet doesn't do. A do-er will always be
more successful than a thinker, whether you like the do-er or not.*

## To think
This book's title draws comparisons to *Waiting for Godot*, and for a
good reason. What I want to tell you is to act, not think. This is
where I want to define two new terms, *thinkocracy* and -- a bit
later -- *actocracy* and *sentiocracy*.

*Thinkocracy is largely: To think. It's a governmental system where
much thought is put into governance, yet not much is enacted. A
thinkocracy is controlled by thinkocrats (the professional term
for "thinker").*

Many people fall into this trap of *thinking* yet not *acting* in a
governmental situation. Vladimir from the play is largely a
thinkocrat, which is also a good thing! Don't get me wrong!

## To act
*Actocracy is: To do, or: To act without thought. Though more
successful than thinkocracy it's arguably worse since thought
is key to most policies. The professional term for do-er (and for
a follower of this governmental system) is actocrat.*

This is -- as mentioned in the definition: Worse than thinkocracy.
In a thinkocracy, the leaders at least give *thought* into their
policies. Impulsive people tend to fall victim to this terrible
system. Many countries in the world -- and some FOSS-projects --
fall victim to a version of this called:

*Actocracy-Democracy is a democracy in which people don't tend
to give much thought into anything, yet they still participate.*

## To balance
*Sentiocracy is: to act and think, and is -- as such -- the most
successful and -- sadly -- utopian governance system of the three
"Waiters' ideologies" (thinkocracy, actocracy and sentiocracy).
It takes aspects from both thinkocracy and actocracy which
inevitably leads to a better world. Not to be confused with
sentiocracy-democracy: A democratic implementation of the
core principles to sentiocracy.*

The above is my formal proposal to mediate between the two sides
of thinkocrat and actocrat, with the preferred version of sentiocracy
being -- of course -- sentiocracy-democracy. *Direct
sentiocracy-democracy* is -- from here on out --one of the core
principles of marxocracy. Well, after a deep philosophical
conversation about the value of waiting, it's time for a
bunch of more shit about waiting!

## FOSS-users and waiting
Many FOSS-users love waiting. Or, I don't know if they exactly *love*
waiting, but they can tolerate it. *"This new feature that was
revealed 5 years ago will SURELY be implemented now... No? I guess
I'll just wait!"* is a toxic relationship with reality that must be
abolished. If you *want* a feature: Push for it! Saying *"I want X feature!"*
is a much more healthy relationship with reality than *"Surely someone will
suggest X feature... Some day..."*. And in the end, if more people just
adopt this toxic mindset -- which I hereby define as *Godotism* -- we'll
have no more people to suggest features!

## The Godotist satire
Once upon a time, there was a man in the US named *Peter Peters*: A very
insignificant and quite frankly *generic* man with no personality. He had
a wife and 2.5 kids (one of them was cut in half by a chainsaw falling
onto their legs) and was quite happy. But one day: *Disaster struck*.
The US army was going to drop a bomb on innocent arabs, but they
accidentally dropped it on Peter Peters' house, killing his whole
family except for the 0.5 of a kid who was only cut in half by some
sharper rubble and was thus 0.25 of a kid. The child was named *Bert
McBert* and he was devastated.

  McBert: Father! Father! We need to rebuild the house!  
  Peters: No.  
  McBert: But we need a place to live!  
  Peters: Yes, my son. But we must stay strong. If we just
wait here: Eventually, some virtuous people will show up and
rebuild the house *for* us!  
  McBert: No? The chances of that happening is less than the
percentage of person I am, that being 25%.  
  Peters: No need to worry. We don't even need to ask for help,
the neighbours will ask for help for us! Look at them, across
the street! They're virtuous, right?  

Across the street, a man named *Robert Roberts* and his son:
*Oliver McOliver* were talking. They seemed to be in the
same predicament, even McOliver was the same percentage
of person McBert was!

  McOliver: Father! Father! We need to rebuild the house!  
  Roberts: No.  
  McOliver: But we need a place to live!  
  Roberts: Yes, my son. But we must stay strong. If we just
wait here: Eventually, some virtuous people will show up and
rebuild the house *for* us!  
  McOliver: No? The chances of that happening is less than the
percentage of person I am, that being 25%.  
  Roberts: No need to worry. We don't even need to ask for help,
the neighbours will ask for help for us! Look at them, across
the street! They're virtuous, right?  

Days pass, and no one is yet to arrive. While McBert is now
starting to realize what is happening, Peters stays ignorant.

  Peters: How come no one has arrived!?  
  McBert: No one is going to arrive. Ask for help.  
  Peters: No! Somebody is going to ask people *for us*.  

  A person suddenly appears.

  ???: Hello! How's it going for you two! My name is *Carla
Carlsen*, and I'm just strolling by!  
  McBert (to Peters): Come on, ask her for help!  
  Peters (to McBert): No, somebody else will!  
  Carlsen: Answer me!

  No answer arrives.

  Carlsen: Well then, I guess I'll be going now!

  Carlsen disappears.

Weeks pass by, and our heroes are starving. Yet they (or McBert,
at least) know that they'll die now. McBert is first to go, leaving
Peters with 0.0 children and an acute case of starvation, yet living
in bliss due to ignorance...
