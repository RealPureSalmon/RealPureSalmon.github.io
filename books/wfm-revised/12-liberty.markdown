# Liberty
Liberty. Y'know, the thing. The thing that, like, hasn't helped anyone (in FOSS).
FOSS-liberty can be summed up with the following satirical piece:

[![Liberty!](/images/liberty.png)](/)

(By the way: The usage of *comic sans* is purely a part of the satire. I condemn
the hate crime of using comic sans and I will not stand for these *radical*
comic sans users, destroying our country!)

Honestly, libertarian FOSS-projects *tend* to be worse... But hey! They're extensible,
am I right? Free and extensible is the only *good* qualities about FOSS-libertarianism.
Speaking of FOSS-libertarianism, it's been 11 chapters, shouldn't I provide a definition
at some point? And should *"at some point"* be now? Yeah, let's go with that.

## Conlibertism
*FOSS-libertarianism is the "FOSS" (Free and Open Source Software) variant of libertarianism,
meaning "freedom in software", this correlates with Fossarchy-Mossarchy, but is more on the
"consuming" side of the FOSS process. But when we speak of FOSS-libertarianism, we might mean
"Pure-FOSS-libertarianism", which is when you can do anything with the consumption of a
FOSS-project.*

But FOSS-libertarianism and Pure-FOSS-libertarianism are very long terms, so we'll call them
"Conlibertism" (Consumption libertarianism) and "Pureconlibertism" (Pure consumption
libertarianism).

## Extensibility
Haha, how I *love* extensibility in FOSS, that's one of the best things about Conlibertism!
Okay, I *do not* love extensibility in FOSS... Or, it's complicated! Here's Marxocracy's
philosophy on extensibility:

*Any unnecessary customization is bad customization.*

Which I *know* the Conlibertists do *not* agree with me on. Their philosophy would be
something more like

*Any customization is good customization.*

Which is idiotic. You can customize but if it's not necessary, why do it?
Overextensibility is the death of everything Marxocracy stands for, and thus,
I shall not stand for it. The reason "Overextensibility is the death of
everything" is as such:

*Lightweightedness in a FOSS-project is -- of course -- one of the most
fundamental parts of a good such. Overextensibility often leads to less
lightweightedness, and as such: Leads to less quality.*

And as such, we can come to the conclusion that *any unnecessary
customization is bad customization.*

## Conrestrictionism
*Conrestrictionism is the idea that -- fundamentally -- software cannot
fully thrive with unlimited consumption. Unlike Conauthoritarianism:
A lot of restrictions on consumption, Conrestrictionists only want
some restriction allowing for a project to thrive.*

This is another fundamental principle of Marxocracy: The belief that
there shouldn't be *many* restrictions on software, but that you can
sacrifice total liberty for a higher quality product and to assure
for the thriving of the FOSS-project. I've said it before and I'll
say it again,

*QUALITY OVER EXTENSIBILITY, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!!!*

Which I personally believe is a really good core principle to hold.

## Consumption principles of Marxocracy
I'd like to present 5 core principles in Marxocracy for consumption,
these should be followed closely. They are

1. Any unnecessary customization is bad customization.
2. Lightweightedness in a FOSS-project is -- of course -- one of the most
fundamental parts of a good such. Overextensibility often leads to less
lightweightedness, and as such: Leads to less quality.
3. Conrestrictionism is a fundamentally good principle and should be the
core of Consumption-Marxocracy.
4. QUALITY OVER EXTENSIBILITY, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!!!
5. The most important fundamental of Conrestrictionism is that some liberties
must be sacrificed for the good of the project as a whole.

## A satirical piece
... You know, I was planning to put a satirical piece right here, but the problem
with libertarianism -- unlike Godotism -- is that it's not very funny, it's just
plain *bad*. I guess I'll use this section to highlight the core problems with
Conlibertism, I guess. These are:

1. In their eyes, *"Any customization is good customization."*
2. It leads to a worse project overall.
3. They prefer extensibility over quality.

It's quite honestly a sad reflection upon our society that these kinds of
philosophies have thrived, since they're largely reactionary. They poke up in
response to authoritarianism in FOSS, and I honestly can't blame them. What
Marxocracy *tries* to achieve is a balance between these two -- now debunked --
ideas.
