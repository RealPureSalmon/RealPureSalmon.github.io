# BDFL
We've come to the worst of the worst of the worst of FOSS governance systems:
*Dictatorship*... Or maybe even *monarchy*. This is a *very* bad way of organizing
a FOSS project and is also *dangerous*. Handing power to a BDFL (Benevolent
Dictator For Life) could prove to be a bad idea because -- believe it or
not -- one person isn't enough. A single person cannot lead *everything*,
and a reasonable person should know that.

## Divine right to rule
*A person should not have full control of something because of founding it*.
A regular, reasonable, non-psychopathic person should very much be in
agreement of this statement. Therefore, this *divine right to rule* that
a founder of a large project believes they inhibit is downright idiotic!
Someone with bad intentions? The BDFL maybe doesn't notice it, bad intentions
are realized and the project goes into crisis.

## Popularity
The "BDFL" governance system is awfully popular. Just for you to get the
picture, here's a list of most known BDFLs of larger FOSS-projects:

### The holy list
- Sylvain Benner
- Vitalik Buterin
- Dries Buytaert
- François Chollet
- Evan Czaplicki
- Laurent Destailleur
- David Heinemeier Hansson
- Rich Hickey
- Adrian Holovaty
- Jacob Kaplan-Moss
- Andrew Kelley
- Xavier Leroy
- Haoyuan Li
- Miles Lubin
- Yukihiro Matsumoto
- Wes McKinney
- Gavin Mendel-Gleason
- Bram Moolenaar (RIP)

- Sébastien Ros
- Mark Shuttleworth
- Jeremy Soller
- Don Syme

- Pauli Virtanen
- Patrick Volkerding
- Nathan Voxland
- Jimmy Wales
- Jeremy Walker
- Shaun Walker
- Larry Wall
- Evan You
- Soumith Chintala

- David Phillips
- Kohsuke Kawaguchi
- Gabor de Mooij

- Lars Hvam
- Sebastián Ramírez
- Bill Hall
- Damien Elmes

So yes, this is an AWFULLY POPULAR governance system for FOSS, which is *insane*,
since it's (arguably) the worst FOSS governance system *ever*! Dictatorship goes
*against* the fundamentals of Marxocracy.

## In smaller projects
*"You little... I'm the BDFL of my small project with 3 stars on Github and
I feel very... Weak and sad"* I hear you say. Well, BDFLs are fine in smaller
projects! Largely due to -- and I'm saying this in the nicest way possible --
the fact that your project is insignificant. No one depends on your project,
but people depend on the bigger ones. In a big project, you need good governance
because, well: People depend on your project. People being allowed to express
their ideas -- a core principle of Marxocracy -- is not allowed under dictatorships.

## The only worse alternative
*"What!?"*, I hear you ask. *"Isn't dictatorship the worst of the worst of the
worst?"*... Yes yet no. There's a worse alternative, but I'm not sure if it qualifies
as a FOSS governance system, and if it did: It wouldn't be enough for a whole chapter.
And that governance system is... **Fake FOSS**! Fake FOSS is basically software that
pretends to be FOSS, yet is not. For an example of this: Winamp! Winamp went open
source a few months ago and it's... Not open source. It should be pretty easy
to understand how Winamp isn't FOSS by just... Reading the 6th section of the
license.

#6. Restrictions  
- No Distribution of Modified Versions: You may not distribute modified versions of the
software, whether in source or binary form.
- No Forking: You may not create, maintain, or distribute a forked version of the software.
- Official Distribution: Only the maintainers of the official repository are allowed to distribute
the software and its modifications.

Wait a second... DID THAT FOSS-PROJECT JUST SAY "NO FORKING OR DISTRIBUTION"!? That is
*actually* insane! And this... Makes it non open-source. Forking and distributions are
not only core principles of Marxocracy, but of FOSS in general! That is... Insane.
