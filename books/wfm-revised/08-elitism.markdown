# Elitism
As you may have figured, many members of FOSS are... Strange in more
than one different ways. While this is a chapter about toxic elitism
in FOSS, other weird behaviours include:
- Tribalism (see [FOSS-culture](/books/wfm-revised/FOSS-culture))
- Cultism
- Totalitarianism

"I'm the elite! I call the shots around here!", is one of the many
phrases uttered out of these dirty elitists' mouths.

## Manifestations
Elitism is not a governance system, we ended our chapter bunch
on governance when we talked about BDFLs! No, elitism manifests in
different governance systems, mostly meritocracy, oligarchy and in a
strange way: Dictatorships.

## Inequality
The higher classes in these systems (devotees/donogarchs/BDFLs) see
themselves as superior or "Knowing best" for the project (or maybe even
the community as a whole, though these governance systems don't tend to
attract as much "community" as democracies). Which leads to great divide
between newcomer/non-donogarch/ordinary and the "elitists", and as such,
the non-elitist may feel demotivated and may slow down contributing or
maybe even completely stop contributing to the project as they're not
awarded what they deserve as the elitists "Know best" and the non-elitist
is not regarded -- neither as a human being or a contributor -- in the
decision-making process.

## Persistence
As we've discussed, the FOSS-corruption cycle is an infinite cycle of
bad FOSS-governance with X system being replaced with oligarchy being replaced
with Y system with then gets replaced with oligarchy being replaced with Z
system, yet elitism remains strong. With the exception of democracy: Elitism
persists trough every system, trough cold tundras and tropical deserts, it
*stays*, and it stays for *long*. Since elitism isn't a governance system, it can't
abide by the FOSS-corruption cycle.

## Change
The elitists know best, and as such: They reject change. They hate change, especially
if the ones pushing for it are the non-elitists! Proposal upon proposal goes like
such (sadly enough):

(*E*: Elitist, *N*: Non-elitist)

*N*: \*Opens pull request adding new features\*  
*E*: Rejected!  
*N*: Why?  
*E*: Because I said so, and I know best!  
*E*: This is a meritocracy, and I'm a frequent contributor!  
*E*: And as such, I am superior to you.  
*N*: That sounds like bullshit.  
*E*: Y-you're bullshit!

You know... I'm starting to notice a correlation between FOSS and the USA Republican
party... Strangely tribal, strangely elitist and strangely discriminatory! Well, uhh...
Let's lighten up the mood with a satirical piece!

## The guide to FOSS-corruption
This is a definitive guide on how to make a *terrible* and *corrupt* (which is a *good*
thing, war is peace) FOSS-project, and also: *How do you really make a hierarchy
(WHICH IS A GOOD THING) in a FOSS-project?* Well, this definitive guide provides
all of the necessary information to finally be an elitist -- and feel happy for once.

### Making your project
The first thing you need to know is that... Well, you need to *have* a project. This
can be done in many different ways: *The Github Way* and
*The AI-Hipster-Hyper-Accelerationalist-Neo-Anarcho-Capitalist-Cultural-Marxist Way*,
what will *you* choose? Of course, we only word the second option that way to make it
seem "unappealing" and "weird", but the actual definition -- which I normally like to
hide to uphold the status quo -- is the following:

*Gitlab and Anti-Monopolism*

Which sounds *way* to appealing, and to uphold the status quo: We of course need to
sabotage everything that is different in any way, so that we can uphold the Microsoft
monopoly on open-source. And as a FOSS-conservative: We're going to choose the status
quo: *The Github Way*. But what is the Github way? Well, make a PAID (support Microsoft
and also: freedom is slavery) organization for your shitty little idea and hope that
it catches on. From now on, there's two ways this could turn out:

1. 99.99999999%: You fail
2. 00.00000001%: You succeed

If you achieve the *00.0000001%* way, continue reading.

### Initiate elitism
Now, start making comments towards new contributors, like: *I know BEST. I am BETTER.*
and start making it so that only seasoned contributors -- no matter the code-quality --
can participate in the community. Also, don't -- UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES -- question
the frequent contributors' pull requests but put non-frequent contributors' pull
requests under criticism upon criticism (the hope is of course that the person gives
up, also: ignorance is bliss), saying "The coding *style* doesn't match up with our
coding style, please fix it". Or maybe even making a bot to respond to all pull
requests on your Github repo saying: "We actually use a MAILING LIST you FUCKING
BUFFOON, go back to STUPID-LAND!", just like Linux:

"Hi @{name}!

Thanks for your contribution to the Linux kernel!

Linux kernel development happens on mailing lists, rather than on GitHub - this GitHub repository is a read-only
mirror that isn't used for accepting contributions. So that your change can become part of Linux, please email it
to us as a patch.

Sending patches isn't quite as simple as sending a pull request, but fortunately it is a well documented process.

Here's what to do:

- Format your contribution according to kernel requirements
- Decide who to send your contribution to
- Set up your system to send your contribution as an email
- Send your contribution and wait for feedback"

Yeah -- I forgot -- use a mailing list even though Github (yes, even Github) is a
superior system. This makes it even more difficult to contribute making sure that only
*real* programmers can contribute, not the average web developer -- but the average
SUPER GOOD DEVELOPER!!!

### Corruption
Now, it's time to hand over your project to a big corporation, like Microsoft -- which
shouldn't be hard if your project is large. Simply, set up a donation option and let
the money flow in!
