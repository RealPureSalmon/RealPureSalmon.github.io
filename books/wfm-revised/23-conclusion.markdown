# Conclusion
Well, that's the end. You can go now.

## The *actual* conclusion
Okay, okay! Let's actually conclude this manifesto. Thank you for reading,
I hope you enjoyed my book/manifesto. Uhm... Well, I think the conclusion
we can come to is that there are *many* problems with FOSS (and IT as a whole),
for example: Anarchism, cultism, tribalism etc. But in the end, it can be fixed.
It can be fixed with the governing system of Marxocracy, wanting collectivization,
anti-fascism, egalitarianism, conrestrictionism, anti-leadership-ism and more. One
could say I spoiled this ending with the "TL;DR" of the prologue, saying

*The optimal way of running a FOSS project is trough direct democracy, we should
own most software collectively and not let ourselves get corrupted by oligarchs and
big companies donating â‚¬10,000,000 to your cause (totally not because they want
to control your project).*

So, what did I learn while making this book? Uhm, I'd say that I learned a *lot*
about the prevalence of politics in FOSS, and how to fix the largely unequal
environment in most FOSS-projects.

## Goodbye
Well... It's time to say goodbye, I guess? Thank you for reading and thank you
for (hopefully) consuming my ideas! Maybe I'll make a vol. II sometimes, but I
don't know. Whatever I do next, it's goodbye for now.
