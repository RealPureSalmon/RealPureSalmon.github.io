# Democracy
Are most FOSS-projects democracies? Uhh... No? Most FOSS-projects
are either dictatorships or following Fossarchy-Mossarchy (the
collective ideology of Fossarchy and Mossarchy). More civilized,
structured and bigger projects might have another way of doing it
but that's in no way guaranteed.

## VIM
VIM (Vi IMproved) is a text editor made by (RIP) Bram Moolenaar.
VIM is what I'd like to call a charitocracy, which in FOSS terms
means the following:

*A charitocracy is a FOSS-governance method that can easily be
summarized in one sentence: Democracy for the charitable. For example:
VIM is charityware and people that donate to the VIM foundation (which
in turn donates to a foundation to help starving children in Uganda)
are the charitocrats. They can engage in direct democracy (which is
also one of the principles of marxocracy).*

Though, for the most part: Bram Moolenaar was a BDFL, so before he
sadly passed away, it was more like a charito-dictatorship (the collective
term for a charitocracy and a dictatorship that coexist). Nowadays:
It's basically a charitocracy.

## Why VIM?
I bring up VIM in a response to the notion that "democracy is impossible in
FOSS", which many people (sadly) seem to be under the impression of. VIM is
a very close example of a FOSS-democracy. People of the world, open source
is supposed to be democratic!

## FOSS-Democracy and Counter-Authoritarianism
FOSS sprung up in response to a increasingly authoritarian market, where
monopolies control everything and the small projects of the world slowly
wither away, never to be seen again. FOSS was able to counteract this
trough helping each other and providing the common man with counter-authoritarian
tools as well as counter-authoritarian software. After hearing this, doesn't
FOSS-Democracy sound like the next step? We can't both be counter-authoritarian
*and* authoritarian, right? Yet Fossarchy-Mossarchy is way to deregulated for a
software development community to ever thrive in. Democracy is the comfortable
life we live in, why not bring it to our software, too?

## Modern FOSS
In modern FOSS, democracies are very rare, even among bigger projects! Godot,
for example: It's by no means a democracy. Democracy is also what I believe to
be the first step toward Marxocracy in the modern FOSS-sphere. Nowadays,
worse systems like meritocracy or maybe even oligarchy dominate the FOSS
market. It is truly a disgusting sight.

## Curbing democracy
Democracy in FOSS -- just like democracy in real life -- is not unbreakable.
A good way to illustrate this is to define an inevitable roadmap for any
FOSS project. I will call this roadmap "The FOSS-corruption cycle":

1. A FOSS project is formed.
2. It gets larger.
3. It assumes X governance system (X = democracy right now).
4. It gets even larger.
5. It opens up a donation option.
6. Large corporation donates ~â‚¬10,000,000.
7. Corporation controls everything.
8. A possible fork is formed, the fork recurses.

What often happens in FOSS is that bigger companies go and invest in smaller
-- yet popular -- projects (for example: Godot is closer to an oligarchy than
a democracy). It's a very sad process that ruins FOSS-projects worldwide and
impacts all of the developers of the impacted project.

## Breaking the cycle
How are we supposed to break the cycle? Break the cycle of corruption in
open source so prevalent in the modern day? I'll give you a second to
think...  3, 2, 1... Okay, please look at step 5. "It opens up a donation
option". What we can do is... Just not. If we don't accept money from
these big corporations, we can't get curbed out of our democracy! Do
not fold! Stay strong and never give up on maintaining both your project,
and democracy.

## Anti-partisanship
A modern democracy tends to be a *representative democracy*. While this *may*
sometimes work in real-life, it never works in FOSS. You see, a party is
less an organization than a package of beliefs, which more often than
not leads to tribalism (if you want to know why that's a problem,
refer to [FOSS-culture](/books/wfm-revised/foss-culture)).
In Marxocracy and FOSS-democracy in general, it's important to be
anti-partisan, meaning not being for any party, and not wanting any
parties. There's very much a reason for me citing *direct democracy*
as a core part of Marxocracy, and not just *democracy*.

## Initiating conversation
If you agree with my ideas and want to spread them: A good way
to do so is to propose democracy to an open-source project you
contribute frequently to. It may be a big project, it may be a
small one. The important thing is to initiate democracy. Every
new democratic project is one step towards full Marxocracy.
For further reading on FOSS-democracy -- which also coincidentally
brings up many of the points about anarchy I've covered --, see
[this paper](https://prezi.com/koxlpmckjpv6/foss-as-a-model-for-participative-democracy/),
which more or less confirms democracy as the right way of
governance for FOSS. Unlike what we'll be covering next:

# Meritocracy
*"The US is a meritocracy"*, one of the most blatant lies
ever told. There's no benefit to working hard, only the people
born into wealth (maybe by your father owning an emerald mine
in Africa, but I don't know) say this, either by blissful
ignorance or out of pure malice. But one thing often overlooked
is if meritocracy is actually a *good* governing system...

## The dangers of meritocracy
Short answer: It's terrible, you can go to the next chapter
now.

Long answer: A persons prosperity under a meritocracy is
based of two traits: "Hard work" and "Intelligence". I
will explain further later, but maybe you can determine
if this is a good system or not based of this:

1. Hard work:    Fail
2. Intelligence: Fail
3. Neither:      Fail
4. Both:         Succeed

Have you thought about your answer? Well, it's... VERY BAD!

### In-equal
We need to stop treating people differently based on how much
they've contributed to a project (contributions = merit in this
case). This is just straight up inequality and discourages
newcomers as they're treated much worse than the "devotees"
of the pack. It's almost like... A class system! This goes
against the principles of Marxocracy, as not everyone
is treated equally. FOSS-meritocracy leads to an eerily
similar class-system as to our real-world, where the
bourgeoise (devotees) are seen as "better" than the
proletariat (newcomers).

### Undemocratic
Meritocracy is largely undemocratic. What I mean by this is that
the newcomers almost have *no* say in anything, while the devotees
(or aristocrats in this situation) have *all* the say in the matter,
leading to a largely undemocratic system with large "class divide.",
which also leads to a hierarchy (and hierarchies are... Bad!?).

### Disorganized
It's unclear who makes the rules in a meritocracy. Is it the lead
developer, is it the people that have been contributing broken
code (yet a lot of it) or is it the people that contribute less,
yet better quality code? Even though I wish the 3rd group would
be the one that controls the project (even though that is not optimal,
as we should all lead the project together), it's not! Yet it's always
unclear if the 1st or 2nd person/group controls the project. It's
incredible disorganized and I'm honestly shocked that it is such
a popular way of governing. Even *Godot* (which we've already
defined as an oligarchy, though) claims to be a meritocracy:

*"But this is not all, Godot development is a true meritocracy. Code is only merged when deemed worthy by the
other developers. Every change is discussed for pros and cons.
This process is led by our large user community, who usually sets our priorities via issues (or just random rants
on our community sites :P). This same community helps with the testing and works directly with developers
implementing each feature to ensure it works as best as possible. Our process is truly community-driven from
beginning to end."*

## How meritocracies are formed
Meritocracies are often formed by well-meaning people that genuinely
believe that meritocracy is a good governing system, while it's not.
I discourage you to harass anybody who owns or maintains a
meritocratic project as they're often well-meaning people who are
simply misinformed (or maybe neoliberals but we shouldn't harass
them anyway \[*maybe*]).

## Republicans and meritocracies
We've already covered how there's already a pretty big part of the
FOSS community that are schizophrenic and don't have a single good opinion.
These people are called "Republicans" and are truly the worst of the worst
of FOSS. Yet, these people -- both in real-life and in FOSS -- Believe that
a meritocracy is only correct and is the correct way of running a FOSS-project.
These people are very, very wrong and have as small of a brain as the chance
of meritocracy succeeding. The people that say "The US is a meritocracy"
though, I believe: Are nationalists in disguise so there's no need to consider
them.

## Ending the meritocracy
*"Well then, if meritocracies are so bad, then lets get rid of them!"*, to that
I answer: *"Yes"*. It's a pretty good idea to end a meritocracy... But how?
Depends on the group you're trying to convert from meritocracy. Sometimes it's
as easy as just telling them *"No meritocracy!"* but it's often more intricate than
that. Don't go as far as to harass people, but opening issues or making public
announcements and calls to end the meritocracy often leads to democracy. This
tends to be a bit harder than ending a democracy, though. It can still fall
victim to the FOSS-corruption cycle with the exception of establishing a
democracy, but that just leads to a worse system: *Oligarchy*. It's next
to impossible to recover from oligarchy as any forks or new projects
will just go back into the FOSS-corruption cycle again and again and
again! But as we discussed, there is a way to escape from the hellhole
of the FOSS-corruption cycle, that being: *Stop accepting donations!*
Yet it tends to be a bit harder with these meritocrats. But if you're
able to reform the meritocracy turned oligarchy by destroying the oligarchy:
Please push for democracy, for gods sake! We can collectively reform if we
just accept change instead of staying with the old and usual. The key to
change is -- of course -- to accept it.
