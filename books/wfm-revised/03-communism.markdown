# Communism
Communism is a word that is very often misused by right-wingers
as "no toothbrush" or "the worst", when it is nowhere close
to that definition. The official definition of communism is:

*A classless, stateless and moneyless society where the
workers control the means of production.*

There are no "means of production" in FOSS (except for
computers and text-editors), so I will be going with
another definition for our "FOSS-Communism":

*A classless (which in our case means "no one is better
than another"), stateless (which in our case means no
BDFLs \[Benevolent Dictator For Life(s)] and no core
leadership) and moneyless (which relates to the
"classless" part, but also means "no oligarchs" and
depending on your decision "no donations") society
where the workers (developers) control the means of
production (being pull-requests and code-contributions,
which is a core part in FOSS anyways).*

Also, to clarify: I am a communist (or a Marxist, to
be precise) and I have my biases. Keep that in mind.

## Marxocracy
So now, why would FOSS-communism be a better way of
running a FOSS-project than Fossarchy or Mossarchy
(see [FOSS-culture](/books/wfm-revised/foss-culture))?
Well, let's disect the formal definition (which
by "formal" I mean "provided from the top of
my head"), part by part:

### Core definition

*A classless (which in our case means "no one is better
than another")*

This should clearly be good. If you have any form of
empathy: You know this is good. Everybody -- in a
formal or informal development environment --
should always be equal.

*stateless (which in our case means no BDFLs \[Benevolent
Dictator For Life(s)] and no core leadership)*

BDFLs are a fundamentally totalitarian idea that should
never be excercised in any environment. This includes
FOSS. And no core leadership is a good idea since
that could easily lead to BDFLs.

*moneyless (which relates to the "classless" part, but
also means "no oligarchs" and depending on your decision
"no donations")*

Oligarchies are *very bad*, that's a part of why the US
is *very bad*. They lead to corruption yet it's basically
a core part of capitalism. "No donations" are a different
story since it's basically about your political stance
on earning money for FOSS.

*the workers (developers) control the means of production
(being pull-requests and code-contributions, which is a
core part in FOSS anyways).*

Yes, this part is a core part of FOSS, and therefore it
should not be a shock that I'm including it in this ideal
"FOSS ideology". FOSS-communism is a very bad name for
an ideology though, and thus I propose "Newage-Marxism"
or "Marxocracy". I'll be going with "Marxocracy" (because
of it being the governing-system version of marxism)
but in reality it doesn't matter.

### Direct democracy
Another part of Marxocracy I want to emphasize is
*direct democracy*, *all* people wanting to vote for
a new feature in your project: Shall. The optimal
way to run this is trough ranked-choice voting,
where you present the voters with 3+ options to
choose from which the voters then rank. Every
voter shall give all options a score from
1-x where x is the amount of options, you then
award the choices the amount (of votes) that
the voter has given it, the choice with the
most votes win and shall be added.

### Benefits
Marxocracy provides a whole lot of benefits that
other governance-ideologies don't provide (such
as Oligarchy and Dictatorship). I have provided
a list below for all people wanting to see the
benefits:

- People are happy - Being able to vote for new
  features in your project will surely make them happy.
- Immune against oligarchs - People wanting to puppeteer
  your project wont be able to if you either set a limit
  on the amount a single person can donate to you, or ban
  donations entirely.
- Everyone is equal - With no core leadership and no
  oligarchs everybody will be equal.

These benefits clearly outline some of the great things
about Marxocracy.
