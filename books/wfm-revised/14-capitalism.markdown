# Venture capitalism
[![Remember kids! Profits are the unpaid wages of the working class!](/images/surplus.png)](/)

I'm a Marxist, I've said that before. Who could've guessed that I'd include
a whole chapter in my manifesto about the evils of capitalism and how it's
slowly ruining FOSS. Think of this as a broader sequel to
["Oligarchy"](/books/wfm-revised/oligarchy#corporate-interest) and
["Corporate interest"](/books/wfm-revised/oligarchy#oligarchy).

## Why?
Why do capitalists invest in FOSS? Well, to seem cool (and also to destroy any
chance of a good FOSS-project of being big before being fully loaded with cash
from Microsoft and Google so that they're the puppeteers), of course! Capitalists
(capitalists, plutocratists, and oligarchs are used interchangebly) just see FOSS
as another venture (hence, venture capitalism) for them to invest in. They see FOSS
as ANOTHER FUCKING COMPANY TO LOAD FULL OF CASH AND REAPING THE FUCKING BENEFITS.

## How?
You *should* be able to solve this yourself. I'll give you three seconds. 3, 2, 1...
Donations. I said it before and I'll say it again: *Once the plutocratists have filled
your pockets with cash, how are you supposed to say no! You want more of that cash,
don't you?* It's a sad reflection on our reality that plutocratists can bribe their
way into FOSS-projects.


## The self made billionaire
is a hoax that has brainwashed a majority of capitalist nations' people. Take our
good pal, machiavellian-president Elon Musk! His father owned an *emerald mine* in
APARTHEID! In reality, the rich people of the world are made by:

- 98% merciless exploitation of the working class.
- 1.9999...% Lottery winners.
- 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000...100x...
0000000000001% Working class people who got lucky.

A lot of these people are "tech broligarchs", e.g:

*(Tech broligarch) A person (often a white cishet man, since yes, that's
inequality for ya) who has made all of their money from tech.*

These tech broligarchs see *money* in open-source, and thus invests in FOSS-projects.
DO NOT LET THEM, PLEASE DO NOT LET THEM.

## How do you solve this?
Well, it can be summed up with:

*Two-hundred-and-forty years of capitalism have brought us to
"neo-feudalism". Perhaps it's time to give communism a try?*

What I mean here is that when (and it's *when*, not *if*) capitalism collapses,
FOSS will immediately stop being corporate and truly become *Free* and Open
Source Software. So, organize, if you want.

Okay, let's brighten up the mood with a *satire piece*!!!

## Mein Unternehmen
My name is Beffrey Jezos and I'm a white heterosexual cis male, the most
*oppressed group* of people. I was born to rich upper-class parents who had
$1B, how little! When I was 20 I started my own business! It's
easy, poor people! You just need hard work, ambition and a small loan of
~$50M! The business was basically "Online delivery service (which I call 'zonama')",
a real good business! I hired some poor people (eww) who I exploit daily and pay them
less than they're worth. I don't let them go to the bathroom daily, and as such they
have to pee in bottles. I'm also anti-union. Why? Because I like money, not
egalitarianism! Th-that's cultural Marxism... Egalitarianism? More like
egali-bad-anism! HAHA! But this is a manifesto after all, so it's time to hear
my unfiltered political opinions who might be a bit antisemitic and also racist.

I don't believe in equal rights. Neither social or economic. I don't believe that
the following are deserving of equal rights:

- Jews
- Muslims
- Blacks
- Asians
- Slavs
- Every other bad race
- Poor people
- Working class people
- Middle class people
- Karl Marx
- Friedrich Engels
- Vladimir Lenin
- Socialists
- Communists
- Socialdemocrats
- Centers
- Marxists
- Maoists
- Stalinists
- Leninists
- Liberals
- Everyone who isn't an anarcho-capitalist
- Everyone who doesn't agree with me

I also believe that there should be no state except for a state that gives me
money in form of corporate welfare, which is a good thing! I should be able to
build up my own gestapo to kill minorities without state intervention! I'm a
nazi-anarcho-capitalist-fordist, and I'm proud of that! I'm proud of exploiting
people! I'M SO PROUD! MURRICA RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
