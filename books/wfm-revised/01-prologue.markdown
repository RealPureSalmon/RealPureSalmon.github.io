# Waiting For Marxocracy: Revised edition
Welcome, and thank you for reading my book! This is a view into the political
landscape of FOSS and IT as a whole. In this book, I explore concepts such as
democracy, oligarchy and corporate interest with a FOSS spin to it. I also try
to design an ultimate governing system for FOSS and IT as a whole. This book
also serves as a manifesto of sorts, presenting clear ideas on how to run a
project.

## DISCLAIMER
This book was revised a few months later to fix... Well, a lot of things...
If you want to read the original version, it's gone. Look at
the previous versions of this website and deploy it using ruby
if you really want to see it.

## TL;DR
The optimal way of running a FOSS project is trough direct democracy, we should
own most software collectively and not let ourselves get corrupted by oligarchs and
big companies donating â‚¬10,000,000 to your cause (totally not because they want
to control your project). If you just want to read a short summarization of my
ideas, theories and the construction of Marxocracy: An ideal governing system,
you are free to read the short [manifesto](/books/wfm-revised/manifesto) at the end of this book.

## How do you read this?
This book is split into different chapters, covering different problems and
solutions of the FOSS-community. You are free to read them in non-chronological
order, but I strongly recommend to read them in order. This book is also split
into 3 different writing types and subjects, they are:
- FOSS
- Politics
- Philosophy

## Get started
So, have you decided to read this book? Are you ready to explore different
ways of controlling FOSS in the most fair way possible? If so, you can go to
