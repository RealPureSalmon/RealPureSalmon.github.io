# Cultism
Republicans and FOSS-users have yet another thing in common: Cultism. USA's
president Donald J. Trump, -- the racist businessman -- has built a kind of
"cult of personality" around himself. And then we have pedophile-sympathizer
Richard Stallman, who has done the same thing.

PRAISE STALLMAN  
ENDORSE STALLMAN  
FORGIVE STALLMAN

## And Stallman returns
Stallman? Why would we mention Stallman again? Well... The thing I mentioned
in ["Tribalism"](/books/wfm-revised/foss-culture#foss-tribalism) was... Only *one* of the controversies.
*"Gasp!"*, I hear you say! But fret not, there's this very good paper on
all of his controversial activity which I've taken a lot of this info from!
So... If you want to read more on the topic, read it [here](https://https://stallman-report.org/).
But basically, this is all of the problematic behaviour that is documented
in the informal paper:

- Distinction between "children" and other minors
- Support of child sexual abuse material
- Defense of sexual misconduct
- Support of sex between adults and minors
- Misrepresentation of sexual assault
- Misrepresentation of sexual harassment
- Support of bestiality
- Support of necrophilia

And we have only mentioned *one* of them. *"But no! He didn't mean it! He's
a different person now!"*, no. It's more like *"Instead of being a pedophile-sympathizer,
he's a pedophilia, sexual-assault, bestiality, necrophilia, sexual-misconduct and child
sexual abuse material sympathizer!"*... So yeah, Stallman is mentally ill, and he should
*probably* get some therapy. But in this context, I don't care about what he did, I only
-- as a FOSS-cultism investigator -- care about what the response from the community was.
NOTHING, NOTHING, NOTHING!

[![You get nothing! You lose! Good day sir!](/images/wonka.jpg)](/)

It's INSANE! It's almost... Cult-like. Is it cult-like? Is there an actual cult of Richard
Stallman that will defend him without question? Is there a... FOSS-cult???

## The FOSS-cults
There are cults upon cults upon cults in the FOSS-community, and it's quite frankly crazy.
One of them *is* "The cult of Richard Stallman", but there are other... FOSS-cults. Here
are just a few of them:

- The Richard Stallman cult
- The Godot cult
- The Arch cult
- The broader Linux cult
- The BSD cult

They *do* exist, and it's quite honestly insane that they do. These cults use techniques
like "negging" and "love-bombing" to recruit people. But unlike hate-groups: These cults
are *mostly* harmless.

## Negging and love-bombing
I'd like to present you with a situation. Imagine, -- just for a second -- that you're a
leftist and you have this friend, he's called... Kevin? Over the years, you've gone sharply
left while Kevin has gone downright fascist. For the last few weeks, Kevin has been
disagreeing with you about *welfare*. You, the leftist: Believe that welfare is an inherently
good idea while he, the fascist: Believes that welfare is for "welfare queens" and "the lazy".
But now, all of a sudden, he's been *respecting you*. He now targets a "them" in the welfare
question with "them" meaning any kind of leftist, and acting like you are somehow *better*
than "them". And even though you don't *agree* with him, it's kind of cool to have his
respect.

This is a recruiting technique, do *not* fall for it. This fascist is trying to convert
you by using a technique called "negging and love-bombing", involving firstly being
mean to you, then being "nice" to you. This is used in *actual* FOSS-cults as well.

## The clear intersection
In this book so far, you might have noticed an... Intersection between the *alt-right
(Republicans)* and the FOSS-community. They act the same! THE SAME! Haven't you noticed
yet? There's a lot of similarities between our pal DJ. T and Richard Stallman. For example,
the

- tribalism,
- negligence,
- conservatism,
- cultism and sometimes
- downright fascism!

This chapter on "cultism" was *actually* the chapter on the correlation between fascists and
the FOSS-community! It's quite frankly *insane* that people forgive Stallman because he
"is an icon"... Just like our pal DJ. T! Just *look* at this blog post by Stallman himself:

05 June 2006 (Dutch pedophiles form political party)

Dutch pedophiles have [formed a political party](https://web.archive.org/web/20070320070854/http://www.iol.co.za:80/index.php?click_id=3&art_id=qw1148983921965B233)
to campaign for legalization.
\[Reference updated on 2018-04-25 because the [old link](https://www.iol.co.za/index.php?click_id=3&art_id=qw1148983921965B233)
was broken.]

*"I am skeptical of the claim that voluntarily pedophilia harms children. The arguments that it
causes harm seem to be based on cases which aren't voluntary, which are then stretched by parents
who are horrified by the idea that their little baby is maturing."*  
\- Richard Stallman

Granted, he did [denounce this later](https://www.stallman.org/archives/2019-sep-dec.html#14_September_2019_(Sex_between_an_adult_and_a_child_is_wrong)),
but the purpose of me bringing this up is that... THE FOSS-CULTISTS DEFENDED HIM! That's
batshit insane. You cannot defend people with this kind of problematic behaviour, neither
Trump nor Stallman! Dear programmers, don't defend pedophile-sympathizers.
