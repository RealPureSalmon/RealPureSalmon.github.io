# Groupthink
For those of you that don't know what *groupthink* is, let's just
define it for a second:

*Groupthink is a psychological phenomenon that occurs within a group of people in
which the desire for harmony or conformity in the group results in an irrational
or dysfunctional decision-making outcome. Cohesiveness, or the desire for cohesiveness,
in a group may produce a tendency among its members to agree at all costs. This causes
the group to minimize conflict and reach a consensus decision without critical
evaluation. Groupthink is a construct of social psychology but has an extensive
reach and influences literature in the fields of communication studies, political
science, management, and organizational theory, as well as important aspects of
deviant religious cult behaviour.*

## FOSS-groupthink
In cults (including [FOSS-cults](/books/wfm-revised/cultism#the-foss-cults)), this
phenomenon is *scarily* prominent. I can honestly guarantee that if this
manifesto gains traction, I'll get *at least* 3 death threats (I'm not that
prominent on the internet tough, so I doubt they'll be able to follow through
with it). Leaders of these cults (like [Richard Stallman](/books/wfm-revised/the-emperor)) are often
able to manipulate the masses into thinking like them. The mentality of
GNU and FOSS as a whole boils down to:

*YOU SHOULDN'T CRITICIZE FOSS.*

But... You should. It's important to be critical of everything (including the
"rebellion"). Take -- for example -- the GNU-cult (not GNU, but the cult aspect
of it): I'm almost 100% sure that if the GNU-cultists *weren't* GNU-cultists,
they *would* criticize Stallman. Any decent human being should criticize Stallman
(refer to ["The emperor"](/books/wfm-revised/the-emperor) for why).

## The importance of criticism
I know I've spent this whole cult section of the book stressing the importance
of *not* being a cultist, but I haven't (shockingly enough) stressed the importance
of being critical of cults. Criticism is -- for example -- what helps a lot of people
to get out of these toxic cults. Criticism is *also* important, because it helps to
crumble the cult leaders facade of greatness and rightfulness.

## Apologetics
*Apologetics is the study and practice of the intellectual defense of a belief system. An
apologist is someone "who speaks or writes in defense of a faith, a cause, or an institution."*

*A cult apologist is someone who consistently or primarily defends the teachings and/or
actions of one or more movements considered to be cults - as defined sociologically
and/or theologically.*

... Are you one? Think about this for just a second. Are you a cult apologist?
Because GNU has many. *"Stallman knows best"* this, *"I'm going to kill you in
your sleep for criticizing our holy leader: Stallman"* that. It's always "Stallman
did nothing wrong", which is almost like praising Hitler because he's... A staple
of the art community! He still killed those 6M jews, you know.

*Cult apologists generally defend their views by claiming to champion religious freedom and
religious tolerance. However, they tend to be particularly intolerant toward those who question
and critique the movements they defend.*

This is the quote that made me able to predict that "if this manifesto gains traction, I'll get
*at least* 3 death threats", and it's honestly a sad reflection upon reality that my prediction
is probably true. The thing with cult apologists is that they -- either intentionally or
unintentionally -- participate in the same doctrine and groupthink as the actual cultists.

*Some cult apologists and their supporters (including, sadly, a handful of Christians), spend much
time and energy attacking the very term "cult apologist." It is telling that, for the most part,
they refuse to deal with the very serious issues surrounding cult apologists. These issues include
(but are not limited to):  
active promotion (intended or unintended) of cults (e.g. Gordon Melton's booklet on Scientology
reads like part of that organization's press kit),  
    actual collaboration with cults  
    financial entanglements  
    a destructive agenda  
    support and promotion of heresy  
faulty research, unsupported conclusions and/or outright misrepresentation*

\- [apologeticsindex.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20040603040900/http://www.apologeticsindex.org/cultapologists/)

Being a cult apologist is -- in a way -- just being a cultist. Even though you might
unintentionally be an apologist you -- as I've said before -- still participate in
the doctrine and groupthink of that cult. Saying *"I don't see anything wrong with
Scientology"* is almost like being a part of that cult since, well, you praise it!
If you know that something is a cult or a sect, DO NOT PRAISE IT, FOR THE LOVE OF
THE LORD!!!

## Anticultcult
*An anticultcult (origin: Anti-cult cult) is a cult that originates from opposition
of another cult (or organization perceived as one), it's an idiotic principle
that always leads to negative effects. Other names include combatcult, rebelcult,
resistocult, pugnacult and proeliumcult*

It's cracy how many anticultcults unironically exist. Take -- for example -- the
anti-godot movement. It's basically a cult which originates from people perceiving
Godot as a cult (spoiler: It's not) and thus creating another cult in the process.
And don't worry, cultists! Groupthink is prominent in these cults too!
