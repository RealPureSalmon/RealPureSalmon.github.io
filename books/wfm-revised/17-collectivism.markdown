# Collectivism
The collective is more important than the individual. In FOSS, this basically means
that the individual doesn't own any code, but the collective (e.g community) owns it.

## Uniocracy
*Uniocracy (Origin: Latin: Union) is a code governing system in which the collective
(or unio, as it is referred to) owns all of the code together and in which no individual
can dictate the direction of the code. Any important legal decision -- such as selling
the code to a 3rd party -- needs to be voted on.*

This is another one of the principles of Marxocracy. Everyone owns the code together. If
this principle is followed, the unio will be equal as everyone owns it together, and no
one can pawn it off to a big corporation. While this might be a bit slow, it's necessary
for an equal society where a FOSS-project can thrive.

## Antiuniocracy
*Antiuniocracy is basically just the anti to uniocracy, it believes that one or a few
people should own the code and not everyone.*

Examples of antiuniocratic governing systems include:
- Dictatorship
- Meritocracy
- Oligarchy
- Plutocracy
- Mossarchy
- Fossarchy  
It's honestly insane how antiuniocratic our modern FOSS-sphere has become.
I mean, who doesn't want collective ownership? Hmm... I guess the
- Dictators,
- Meritocrats,
- Oligarchs,
- Plutocrats,
- Mossarchs and
- Fossarchs  
but why? Isn't it just good? Well, these people believe that collective ownership
is bad, but for different reasons. But the core reason is basically "I'm better
than the normal contributor!", or at least that's it for Dictatorships, Meritocracies,
Oligarchies, Plutocracies and Mossarchies but why Fossarchies? Well, that boils down
to "No one owns anything and everyone can do anything", AKA a "nomadic practice". For
the first 5 it's elitism but for the last one it's nomadic.

## Democracy?
*"But what about democracy?"*, I hear you ask. Well, it depends on what the populus
wants. In marxocracy it's very much uniocratic but in others, it's not. Generally,
of all of the FOSS-democracies, they're

- 60% antiuniocratic,
- 39% prouniocratic and
- 1% somewhere in between

I think we can all come to the same conclusion, here. We need to increase the
percentage of uniocratic projects, whether that be by pushing change in bigger
projects or dare I say, forking it! Uniocracy is a net good on society and we
need to increase the percentage of projects following the uniocratic principles,
if not marxocracy as a whole!

## Oh, look! It's the Republicans!
For the most *shocking* plot twist of the century, I'll be returning to criticizing
the big R Republicans and exploring their correlation to FOSS. *Magically*, Republicans
also don't like uniocracy. *"When a white cisgender heterosexual male born to rich
parents who attended private school and whose entire personality is built on being
a nazi succeeds, just let them succeed!"*, they say. A communists politics boils
down to *"Egalitarianism is good"* while the fascists politics boils down to
*"Egalitarianism is so super duper bad!"* (just a reminder, the Republicans are
fascists, or at least rightist-populist). *"We shouldn't own things collectively"*,
the greedy capitalist pigs say. *"WE ARE BETTER THAN THE POOR PERSON."*

Also, come to think of it, isn't Trump like... *Scarily* similar to "mein f√ºhrer"
AKA Adolf Hitler? They talk a lot about vermin and they're both fascist. They
have a lot of the same talking points. Come to think of it, Trump, did you
*read* mein kampf? I've heard it's *really* bad because it came from Hitler
rambling while pacing from back and forth in prison cell he was in. Trump
*narrowly* escaped *that* fate! I bet he'll be pacing back and forth in the
white house while writing *his* manifesto.

## On the AI question
I want to dedicate the last section of this chapter to AI collectivization.
Once upon a time a person I knew said something like:

*"\[Communism and tech don't go together and communism is bad] /.../ Unless
you're like a 'Tech bro communist' who wants to own AI collectively."*

I -- being the person I am -- responded:

*"I do in fact want to own AI collectively!"*

I said this after pondering for 2s and it was kind of impulsive for me to
say. But when I thought more and more and more about it, I realized... I
was probably correct? Owning AI collectively would help stop corporate
greed and make *everyone* happy. Okay, so this is the pitch: A super
duper good AI which everyone owns collectively, commun\[ai]ism!
