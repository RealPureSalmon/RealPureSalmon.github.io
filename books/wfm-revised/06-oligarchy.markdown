# Oligarchy
Okay... What do I mean with "Oligarchy"? I've been referring
to it for chapter upon chapter yet never provided an accurate
description for it. What I refer to as oligarchy can often
be swapped out for "donogarchy", which I define as:

*Donogarchy can be simplified -- just like "Charitocracy" --, into
a single sentence: Rule of the donators. People who donate to a
designated project rule it. What differentiates this from a
charitocracy is that this money doesn't go to a charity, but
to either the projects foundation or the owners wallet.*

But it is almost the same as oligarchy: *Rule of the rich*,
and oligarchy is a more well-known term (since I just defined
"donogarchy" here on the spot). It's a stupid governing
system whose only fans are schizophrenic weirdos who sit in
their room staring at a wall for 23 hours a day, as nobody in their
right mind would want rich people -- or donators -- to rule. There's
no freedom here, it's just *"Do what I say because I'm paying you"*!

## The power
Just to give you a sense of what these oligarchs will do if they even
get a whiff of you doing something you want. Godot -- an oligarchy --
experienced this under the ["Wokot controversy"](https://elisstaaf.github.io/books/wfm-revised/foss-culture#godot-foundation).
A bunch of oligarchs got really mad that Godot -- prepare for something
shocking -- cares about gay people? MIND BLOWN! So, they left and created
an "apolitical" (by which I mean: "conservative nationalist") fork of the
Godot engine known as "Redot" (an awful name for an awful engine made by
awful people). By the way, Redot is several commits behind Godot, so it's
inferior to its "woke" counterpart.

## Capitalism versus FOSS
I think it has become increasingly clear that a lot of these oligarchs (who
I will be referring to "corporations" \[because it is mostly corporations])
are only donating to the FOSS-projects because it wants full control of
the project, and to ruin the chances of a FOSS-democracy ever becoming popular,
for their own self interests. No, Microsoft. You do *not* care about FOSS, if so:
you would have ported MS-Office to Linux. It's crazy how these corporations can
basically buy FOSS using bribery -- since it is basically bribery -- to ruin all
of the chances of free software. It has *truly* become *Capitalism versus FOSS*.

# Corporate interest
This whole oligarchy situation brings me to a more broad subject in FOSS:
*Corporate interest*. Big business have slowly been creeping their way
into FOSS, for example: Microsoft, who was (and still is, though they wouldn't
like to admit it) so against open source, and now:

(*M*: Microsoft, *F*: FOSS purist)

*M*: We have decided to enter the open source community!  
*F*: Weren't you against FOSS like... An hour ago?  
*M*: No... That never happened. War is peace.  
*F*: What? This is getting really strange.  
*M*: Open-source is the best! Don't boycott us!  
*M*: But also... We're going to force you to use our AI-spyware!  
*F*: What the..?  
*M*: WAR IS PEACE. FREEDOM IS SLAVERY. IGNORANCE IS BLISS.

Which is... Really strange, yet is working. I bet less people would be
in the MS-sphere if Microsoft didn't have VSCode, for example. Speaking of
VSCode, it's just another Microsoft monopoly, hidden under a thin veil of
"FOSS" and "Open-source".

## VSCode
It is downright insane how popular VSCode is. It's "Just another FOSS project",
right? No. Just another monopoly. It's crazy how the public doesn't understand
that it's just another stupid Microsoft product. Speaking of "Microsoft product",
VSCode is programmed in TypeScript: A Microsoft-made language! Shocking! Microsoft
does what it can to push TypeScript to the top of every algorithm (same with VSCode).
The downright *insane* thing with VSCode is that they're basically brainwashing the
masses to develop *for them*. They say, and I quote:

*"\[...] we (Microsoft) develop the Visual Studio Code product
together with **the community**. \[...]"*

What will they do next, compile a 1984 (capitalist editon) style propaganda message,
oh I could only imagine! Just imagine:

MICROSOFT IS OPEN SOURCE.  
FOSS IS SLAVERY.  
MINDLESS CONSUMPTION IS BLISS.

## A call to action
In our modern FOSS-sphere, the monopolies of the world are thriving. We willingly
welcome them into our counter-authoritarian sphere and let them monopolize it,
killing our open-source initiative and turning the FOSS-community into just another
monopolized puppet. Counter-authoritarians, we must unite to rid this
market-authoritarian threat of the monopolies! We must save FOSS, and thus save
the internet in the process! They don't know that *we* control the internet, *we*
have the fundamentals for it! *We* have most of the programming languages, and they
cannot take that away from *us*! *We* have Linux, GNU and so much more! They cannot
break us! This is a formal call to action, to all of you counter-authoritarians!
*We* own the software, and no one can steal that from us! Remember who controls
the modern world? *Us*.

Well, that sounded awfully radical. But yes, I'm being completely honest and  
hope more people take up my call to action to save open source. Thank you.
